			<h2>Our Mission</h2>

				<p><strong>Saluda Valley Town Hall</strong> is a non-profit organization that is run by an <em>all-volunteer board</em> of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and entertain our audience!</p>

				<p> As one or our members told us:</p>

				<blockquote>Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.</blockquote>

				<p>We hope you'll join us as we celebrate our 78th year of service to the Valley.</p>
